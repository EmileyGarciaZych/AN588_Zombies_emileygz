# AN 588 Homework 3: Some of my best friends are Zombies...

```{r}
zombies = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/zombies.csv') ##load file into zombies data frame...
head (zombies) 
```

## 1) Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education). NOTE: You will not want to use the built in var() and sd() commands as these are for samples.

```{r}

##calculating height mean
height_mean <- mean(zombies$height) ##use mean() to find the mean of all the heights in the zombie data frame
height_mean ##display

## standard deviation
sd.p=function(x){sd(x)*sqrt((length(x)-1)/length(x))} ##create a standard deviation of population function
sd.p(zombies$height) ##use function to identify the standard deviation of population of all the heights...

##calculating weight mean
weight_mean <- mean(zombies$weight)  ##use mean() to find the mean of all the weights in the zombie data frame
weight_mean ##display
sd.p(zombies$weight) ##use function to identify the standard deviation of population of all the weights

## calculating age mean
age_mean <- mean(zombies$age) ##use mean() to find the mean of all the ages in the zombie data frame
age_mean #display
sd.p(zombies$age) ##use function to identify the standard deviation of population of all the ages

## calculating mean of number of zombies killed
numkilled_mean <- mean(zombies$zombies_killed) ##use mean() to find the mean of all the zombies killed in the zombie data frame
numkilled_mean #display
sd.p(zombies$zombies_killed) ##use function to identify the standard deviation of population of all the zombies killed

##calculating mean of years of education
yearsofedu_mean <- mean(zombies$years_of_education) ##use mean() to find the mean of all the years of education in the zombie data frame
yearsofedu_mean #display
sd.p(zombies$years_of_education) ##use function to identify the standard deviation of population of all the years of education
```

## 2) Use {ggplot} to make boxplots of each of these variables by gender.

Height & Gender Box Plot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
class(zombies)
ggplot(zombies, aes(x=gender, y = height, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape = 8, size = 2, color = "white") ##use ggplot box plot function. Change y to each variable as you go down. 
```

```{r}
ggplot(zombies, aes(x=gender, y = weight, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape = 8, size = 2, color = "white")
```

```{r}
ggplot(zombies, aes(x=gender, y = age, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape = 8, size = 2, color = "white")
```

```{r}
ggplot(zombies, aes(x=gender, y = zombies_killed, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape = 8, size = 2, color = "white")
```

```{r}
ggplot(zombies, aes(x=gender, y = years_of_education, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape = 8, size = 2, color = "white")
```

## 3) Use {ggplot} to make scatter plots of height and weight in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way?

```{r}
ggplot(zombies, aes(x=age, y = height)) + geom_point(col = '#78c165')

ggplot(zombies, aes(x=age, y = weight)) + geom_point(col = '#64484f')
```

These variables do seem to be related as they are both positively correlated with age. As age increases, so does height and weight.

## 4) Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not (hint: not all are drawn from the normal distribution)? For those that are not normal, can you determine from which common distribution they are drawn?

```{r}
qqnorm(zombies$height)
hist(zombies$height, col = '#d3e397')
```

\*normal distribution

```{r}
qqnorm(zombies$weight)
hist(zombies$weight,col = '#de6c6b')
```

\*normal distribution

```{r}
qqnorm(zombies$age)
hist(zombies$age, col = '#64484f')

```

\*normal distribution

```{r}
qqnorm(zombies$zombies_killed)
hist(zombies$zombies_killed, col = '#a41e1f')

```

\*Skewed to the left

```{r}
qqnorm(zombies$years_of_education)
hist(zombies$years_of_education, col = '#78c165')

```

\*Skewed to the left

## 5) Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombie survivors (without replacement) from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable. Also estimate the standard error for each variable, and construct the 95% confidence interval for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, you may need to base your estimate of the CIs on slightly different code than for the normal...

```{r}
length(zombies$id)
new_sample <- sample(zombies$id, 30, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
new_sample
zombies[new_sample,]
new_sample_data <- zombies[new_sample,]
```


```{r}
is.atomic(new_sample_data)
library ("plotrix")

sample_height_mean <- mean(new_sample_data$height)
sample_height_mean
## standard deviation
sd(new_sample_data$height)
sample_standard_error_height <- std.error(new_sample_data$height)

##ConfidenceInterval(95%)
lower <- sample_height_mean - qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_height
upper <- sample_height_mean + qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_height
ci_height <- c(lower,upper)
ci_height

##calculating weight mean
sample_weight_mean <- mean(new_sample_data$weight)
sample_weight_mean
sd(new_sample_data$weight)
sample_standard_error_weight <- std.error(new_sample_data$weight)

##ConfidenceInterval(95%)
lower <- sample_weight_mean - qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_weight
upper <- sample_weight_mean + qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_weight
ci_weight <- c(lower,upper)
ci_weight


## calculating age mean
sample_age_mean <- mean(new_sample_data$age)
sample_age_mean
sd(new_sample_data$age)
sample_standard_error_age <- std.error(new_sample_data$age)

##ConfidenceInterval(95%)
lower <- sample_age_mean - qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_age
upper <- sample_age_mean + qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_age
ci_age <- c(lower,upper)
ci_age

## calculating mean of number of zombies killed
sample_numkilled_mean <- mean(new_sample_data$zombies_killed)
sample_numkilled_mean
sd(new_sample_data$zombies_killed)
sample_standard_error_killed <- std.error(new_sample_data$zombies_killed)

##ConfidenceInterval(95%)
lower <- sample_numkilled_mean - qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_killed
upper <- sample_numkilled_mean + qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_killed
ci_age <- c(lower,upper)
ci_age

##calculating mean of years of education
sample_yearsofedu_mean <- mean(new_sample_data$years_of_education)
sample_yearsofedu_mean
sd(new_sample_data$years_of_education)
sample_standard_error_years_of_edu <- std.error(new_sample_data$years_of_education)

##ConfidenceInterval(95%)
lower <- sample_yearsofedu_mean - qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_years_of_edu
upper <- sample_yearsofedu_mean + qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sample_standard_error_years_of_edu
ci_yearsofedu <- c(lower,upper)
ci_yearsofedu
```

## 6) Now draw 99 more random samples of 30 zombie apocalypse survivors, and calculate the mean for each variable for each of these samples. Together with the first sample you drew, you now have a set of 100 means for each variable (each based on 30 observations), which constitutes a sampling distribution for each variable. What are the means and standard deviations of this distribution of means for each variable? How do the standard deviations of means compare to the standard errors estimated in [5]? What do these sampling distributions look like (a graph might help here)? Are they normally distributed? What about for those variables that you concluded were not originally drawn from a normal distribution?

```{r}
sample_size <- 30 #number of observations in each sample
num_samples <- 99 #total number of samples to draw
##sample_ids <- numeric(num_samples)

##sample_means_height <- numeric(num_samples) #create a vector to store all the means
##sample_means_height[1] <- sample_height_mean #store the mean from problem 5 in the vector

#draw 99 more samples and store that data in the vector
##for(i in 2:num_samples) {
 ## sample_ids[i]<- sample(zombies$id, sample_size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
##}

##
##if (i in 2:num_samples){
##  sample_means_height <- mean(zombies[sample_ids].height)
 ## sample_means_weight <- mean(zombies[sample_ids].weight)
 ## sample_means_age <- mean(zombies[sample_ids].weight)
##  sample_means_zombies_killed <- mean(zombies[sample_ids].weight)
##}

```

Reflection: 
1) I learned how to reduce clutter by not printing so much data. Instead I only pulled what I needed. 
2) I would have liked to see more visually aesthetic graphs and colors. It's an easy thing that can make the code seem more developed. 
3) I misunderstood problem #6 and was unable to attend office hours in time to figure out the solution. I saw other people use different samples to calculate the mean of each variable but I was under the impression it was supposed to be the same sample. I came up with a set of instructions to achieve this but was unable to achieve it in actual code. I plan on continuing to work on it and bring it to office hours for further discussion. 
4) The annotation of my peer was really well done and easy to interpret. It was essentially on every line which made it easy to follow.
